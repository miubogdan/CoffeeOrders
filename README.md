# Coffee Sales Projects

## Project Overview
In this project Iâ€™m gathering the data, transform it then use pivot tables and pivot charts to build a dynamic interactive coffee sales dashboard. The dashboard includes line chart with total sales over time by the type of coffee, option to filter data by period/size/card/roast type, sales by country and top 5 customers. 

## Key features
-	Filter data by periods
-	View top 5 customers
-	Sales view by country
-	Total sales over time line chart by the type of coffee
-	Filtering by roast type, size and loyalty card

## Cleaning techniques used
-	Populating the columns from different tables using vlookups/xlookups
-	Using INDEX MATCH to gather the product data
-	Using IF to modify abbreviated names into full names (Ara, Rob to Arabica, Robusta)
-	Formatting: changing the date format, adding units of measurement, adding currency
-	Removing duplicates
